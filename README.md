# Metal-Scrap-Classifier

## About
The Metal Scrap Classifier is a project aimed at classifying different types of metal scraps using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for development and demonstration.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements machine learning algorithms to classify metal scraps.
- **Data Processing**: Includes data preprocessing steps for preparing the dataset.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Code and documentation are provided in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Diveshrao1708/Metal-Scrap-Classifier.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Metal-Scrap-Classifier
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    Ensure you have `pip` installed. Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   If there is no `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the dependencies used in the project.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook MM206.ipynb
    ```

## Usage
To use the classifier, open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions provided within the notebook to train and test the model.
